ALGORITHM:
1.start
2.set a variable max to the first element of the array.
3.Iterate through the remaining elements of the array.
4.for each element, compare it with the current max. If the element is greater than max, update max to that element.
5.After iterating through all elements, the variable max will contain the maximum element of the array.
6.return max as the result.
7.stop
